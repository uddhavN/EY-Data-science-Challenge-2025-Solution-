EY 2025 Open Science AI & Data Challenge: Cooling Urban Heat Islands - Solution
The EY 2025 Open Science AI & Data Challenge represents a critical initiative addressing one of the most pressing urban climate challenges of our time. This comprehensive sample solution demonstrates how artificial intelligence and satellite data can be leveraged to combat urban heat islands and create more resilient cities.
Challenge Overview and Objectives
The 2025 EY Open Science AI & Data Challenge focuses specifically on cooling urban heat islands, a phenomenon where cities experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. Urban heat islands can increase city temperatures by up to 8°C compared to rural surroundings, creating substantial challenges for public health, energy consumption, and quality of life. The challenge has attracted over 10,000 participants from more than 115 countries, demonstrating the global urgency of this issue.
The primary objective is to develop machine learning models using satellite datasets to forecast temperatures across cities and help urban planners design more livable and resilient communities. Participants must create data-driven solutions that can identify heat island hotspots, predict temperature patterns, and recommend evidence-based cooling interventions for municipal decision-makers.
Methodology Framework
Data Sources and Integration
Our comprehensive approach integrates multiple satellite data sources to achieve high-accuracy temperature prediction. The methodology leverages Landsat 8/9 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data for land surface temperature retrieval at 30-meter resolution, providing detailed spatial information for urban analysis. MODIS Land Surface Temperature products offer daily temporal coverage at 1-kilometer resolution, enabling trend analysis and temporal modeling.
Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of satellite-based urban heat island monitoring, with Landsat data showing excellent agreement (R² of 0.94) with ground-truth measurements. The integration of multiple sensors addresses the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution that has historically limited satellite-based temperature analysis.
Advanced preprocessing techniques include atmospheric correction using single-channel algorithms, water vapor correction using NCEP reanalysis data, and emissivity correction based on the ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset. Quality control measures incorporate cloud masking, outlier detection, and temporal gap-filling to ensure data reliability.
Urban Heat Island Intensity Calculation
The solution employs the Dynamic Equal-Area (DEA) method to calculate Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII), which reduces confounding factors through a dynamic cyclic process. This approach addresses limitations of traditional methods that focus solely on clear-sky conditions and often overlook anthropogenic disturbances. Research shows that UHII is greater than zero in more than 80% of studied cities globally, with average magnitudes around 1.0°C during the day and 0.8°C at night.
Studies from various urban environments demonstrate significant correlations between building density (0.89) and road density (0.823) with UHI intensity, while green areas show moderate negative correlation (-0.56). Our methodology incorporates these relationships to provide accurate heat island characterization across different urban morphologies.
Machine Learning Approaches
The sample solution implements multiple machine learning algorithms to achieve robust temperature prediction capabilities. Research indicates that ensemble methods combining Random Forest, XGBoost, and Convolutional Neural Networks achieve superior performance compared to individual models. State-of-the-art approaches using Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) have demonstrated mean absolute errors less than 1.5°C for urban temperature prediction.
Recent advances in deep learning for satellite imagery analysis show particular promise for urban heat island applications. CNN-based architectures outperform traditional models in spatial weather prediction tasks, while hybrid CNN+LSTM models offer superior performance for time-dependent meteorological forecasting. Our implementation leverages these findings to create a comprehensive prediction framework.

Feature Importance Analysis

Feature importance analysis showing which factors most strongly predict urban heat island intensity
Feature importance analysis reveals critical insights into the drivers of urban heat island effects. Air temperature emerges as the primary predictor (24.5% importance), followed by vegetation indices (18.9%) and building density (15.6%).
These findings align with established urban climatology research demonstrating the dominant role of atmospheric conditions and surface characteristics in determining local temperatures.
The significant importance of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) confirms the cooling effect of urban vegetation, supporting strategies focused on green infrastructure development. Studies show that parks can reduce surrounding temperatures by 2-3°C, creating beneficial urban cool islands.
Building and road density features collectively account for over 25% of model importance, highlighting the critical role of urban morphology in heat island formation. Research confirms that over 90% of impervious surfaces belong to heat island areas, while over 80% of vegetation areas provide cooling benefits.
Urban Heat Island Distribution
Temperature distribution analysis reveals distinct patterns across urban environments. The majority of areas (31.7%) fall within the 25-30°C range, representing moderate urban heating conditions. High-temperature zones (>35°C) comprise 14.6% of analyzed areas, indicating significant heat island intensity that requires immediate intervention.
The UHII distribution shows increasing intensity with temperature, reaching maximum values of 7.2°C in the hottest urban areas. This pattern aligns with research from major metropolitan areas where heat island intensity can exceed 5°C during peak conditions.
